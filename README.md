# GraalVM Spring Boot Hands on Labs
Accelerating and Optimizing SpringBoot Applications with GraalVM Universal Virtual Machine
## Overview
A Workshop for *Spring Boot*  lovers that will introduce & demonstrate some of the coolest things you can do with GraalVM.
The workshop is divided into a number of sub-pages, each largely self-contained, that cover one aspect of GraalVM Native Image.
